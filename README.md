# Updated-Portfolio

I created a new portfolio, coded from scratch (no template), to showcase my projects and homework thus far. 

Landing page includes:
    - my name, number, email and an 'About Me'
    - (4) shapes with icons that direct you to either my Portfolio, contact form, my LinkedIn, or GitHub
    - sticky footer
    
About Me Page (click the 'About Me' under phone and email) includes:
    - my background and resume (when clicked)
    
Portfolio Page includes: 
    -(4) of my favorite HW's and project #1 *note: i didn't put titles because the images included them*
    -when you click on each individual image for the project, it will redirect you to my deployable github page
    
Contact Page includes: 
    -Form for user to include their name, phone number and email
